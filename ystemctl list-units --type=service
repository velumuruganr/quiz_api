LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.
[0;1;39m57 loaded units listed.[0m Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
